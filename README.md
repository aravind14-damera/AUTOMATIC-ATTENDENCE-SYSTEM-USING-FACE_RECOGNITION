– Built a face recognition system capable of detecting and recognizing faces from images and live camera feed.
– Implemented Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and applied LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) for recognition.
– Designed a dataset collection pipeline and integrated real-time recognition for applications such as automated attendance
 and security systems.
 This is our project An Automatic attendence system using face recognition
